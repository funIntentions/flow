-- Local Average Matching Strategy:
-- This strategy first calculates the average demand during the day from the load profile of the building.
-- The storage strategies goal is for this buildingâ€™s final demand profile (aggregate of the load profile and the storage profile) to remain flat and constant at this average.
-- To achieve this, the strategy will charge whenever demand is lower than the average and release energy whenever the demand is higher than the average.
--
-- input:
-- storageDevice - the storage device that is running this strategy
-- building - the building that owns the storage device that is running this strategy
-- simulationStatus - data that describes the current state of the simulation
--
-- output:
-- newStorageProfile - describes when the storage device will be storing or releasing energy and the amount of energy transferred in that moment
