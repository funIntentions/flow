Future Thoughts

On Going
- Demand chart doesn't update properly with an update rate of years, weeks or months
- Cleanup the task manager, remove the testTask from SystemController and have it created in TaskManager if possible
- If the simulation is running/unsaved the Loading Default and Loading file should halt the simulation, but first prompt the user if they're sure.
- Editing the simulation start & end date and the update rate should be disabled while the simulation is running.
- Editing the current strategies (New panel for each strategy)
- Display information specific to particular structures, rank structures based on cost savings **
- Weather affecting simulation

Future
- Device Usages/Patterns (and Weather Patterns if that's how it's done too) will need to be able to be altered depending on the season and weekends.

QUESTIONS:
- Should every button but the run, pause, reset be disabled while the simulation is running? Also should you have to pause before resetting the simulation?
- Plans for the graphics panel? Changing visuals (lights on in houses with power, polluted air when emissions are high)
- Instead of years, weeks, months for update rates, have an calculate now which just processes everything at the same time? Not sure how that will handle storage strategies
- Weather simulation, I'd recommend allowing the user to specify the weather patterns similar to how the user can specify device usage times, Cloud Coverage 60% 6:00 to 7:00, etc.
    - It's time consuming to construct an accurate simulation for weather?
- Plant improvement? Currently the price of electricity from a power plant is fixed and price shifts occur only when more plants are deployed to help meet demand.
    Should an individual plants price vary based on how much of it's capacity is being used?
