Future Thoughts
- Create prefabs/Load in prefabs from a XML file
- Redundancy issue - isPartOf composedOf Owns and other relationships of composition become redundant when represented in software. Particularly with prehabs/groups that will group individuals together into units.
- Alternatively efforts can be focused on representing everything through the simulation

- Error occurs when property value is set to nothing
- Prefab design (initially just a collection)
- Basic prefab representation (how they get displayed in instances)
- Displaying and editing a prefabs components (Do next) & think about unifying information headed to the selection panel (involves switching to Hashmap)
- Prefab tab, instances will then be created from the prefab tab
- By default don't display the class, object and data property tabs (just have individuals). Make a views menu item and allow users to add desired tabs from that.
