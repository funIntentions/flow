Future Thoughts

On Going
- Demand chart doesn't update properly with an update rate of years, weeks or months
- Cleanup the task manager, remove the testTask from SystemController and have it created in TaskManager if possible
- If the simulation is running/unsaved the Loading Default and Loading file should halt the simulation, but first prompt the user if they're sure.
- Editing the current strategies (New panel for each strategy)
- Weather affecting simulation
- Time Spans expanded to allow weekends and seasons

- Messages
- Geographic

Future
- Device Usages/Patterns (and Weather Patterns if that's how it's done too) will need to be able to be altered depending on the season and weekends.

QUESTIONS:
- Plans for the graphics panel? Changing visuals (lights on in houses with power, polluted air when emissions are high)
- Instead of years, weeks, months for update rates, have an calculate now which just processes everything at the same time? Not sure how that will handle storage strategies
- Weather simulation, I'd recommend allowing the user to specify the weather patterns similar to how the user can specify device usage times, Cloud Coverage 60% 6:00 to 7:00, etc.
    - It's time consuming to construct an accurate simulation for weather?
