- Pressing okay during structure editing will automatically revert to the last valid value
- Cleanup the task manager, remove the testTask from SystemController and have it created in TaskManager if possible
- Structure Creation should preform a robust check on the entered name (e.i. Are there characters? Are they valid characters.. no : or }, etc)
