Future Thoughts

On Going
- Template structures should have their load profile displayed as well
- Demand chart doesn't update properly with an update rate of years, weeks or months
- Deleting Devices while editing their names causes an error
- The simulation needs to be reset and rerun once the update rate has changed
- Cleanup the task manager, remove the testTask from SystemController and have it created in TaskManager if possible
