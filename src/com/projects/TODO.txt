Future Thoughts

On Going
TODO: allow variable consumption and production!! Email Aaron the current build
- Cleanup the task manager, remove the testTask from SystemController and have it created in TaskManager if possible
- Structure Creation should preform a robust check on the entered name (e.i. Are there characters? Are they valid characters.. no : or }, etc)
QUESTIONs:
 - Power plant properties determining production based on capacity and demand
	- how are power plants used in sync (i.e. hydro and nuclear all the time but peak hydro and gas only in peak hours... Also how do solar farms fit into the picture?)
 - How should the power plant's properties be? Since they often operate at capacities like 1000MW - 3000MW, 
	they produce quantities of energy that could supply large cities which would take a ages to realistically construct in this simulation. 
	If the region modelled in the simulation had full access to all the energy produced by a plant, there likely wouldn't be many meaningful peak times when so much excess energy is already being produced.
		- could say that this region only gets routed something like 10% of the energy produced by the power plant?
 - He's explained it a bit but what questions will the simulation be finding answers for? Look up previous emails.
	- Is this about making decisions with limited information... Using storage to offset peak times... what else could it be about...
