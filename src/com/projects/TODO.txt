Tidying Up
* If the simulation is running/unsaved the Loading Default and Loading file should halt the simulation, but first prompt the user if they're sure.
- Change units from Wh to kWh
    - Just the demand charts?
* Add border/labels to the overview display for Emission and Expense ranking
* Use or remove standby consumption in device properties
* Remove the power property from device properties
* Add Discharge property to storage devices
* Don't display the Daily Device Usage Scheduler then energy sources or storage are selected
* reduce size of device usage buttons (add/remove)
- Supply and Demand real time charts don't start on the proper date
- Come up with a better name than Project SmartGrid
* Polish the properties -> remove the camel case and add units
* Remove the now unsupported update rates -> weeks, months and years
* Daily Stats should indicate that time of day is in minutes
* Selection panel should display the structures properties next to the load profile (this means displaying a lot of information...Worth it?)
* Removed cancel option from structure editor since it didn't actually cancel any changes. (now you can only "close")
- Table spacing ratio should be adjusted, at the moment it looks awkward
- Errors in time spans editing when input is unparseable
* Strange demand spikes are actually expected. They happen when two devices time spans overlap for a single minute

- Auto-increment the position property of structures
- Implement Energy Sources
    - Remove unused properties

On Going
- Cleanup the task manager, remove the testTask from SystemController and have it created in TaskManager if possible
- Editing the current strategies (New panel for each strategy)
- Weather affecting simulation
- Time Spans expanded to allow weekends and seasons

- Messages
- Geographic

Future
- Device Usages/Patterns (and Weather Patterns if that's how it's done too) will need to be able to be altered depending on the season and weekends.

QUESTIONS:
- Plans for the graphics panel? Changing visuals (lights on in houses with power, polluted air when emissions are high)
- Have an calculate now which just processes everything at the same time? Not sure how that will handle storage strategies
- Weather simulation, simple variation/energy fluctuation parameter
