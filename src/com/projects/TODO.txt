Future Thoughts

On Going
- Demand chart doesn't update properly with an update rate of years, weeks or months
- The simulation needs to be reset and rerun once the update rate has changed
- Cleanup the task manager, remove the testTask from SystemController and have it created in TaskManager if possible

QUESTIONS:
- Should every button but the run, pause, reset be disabled while the simulation is running? Also should you have to pause before resetting the simulation?
