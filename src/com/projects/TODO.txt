Future Thoughts

On Going
- Demand chart doesn't update properly with an update rate of years, weeks or months
- The simulation needs to be reset and rerun once the update rate has changed
- Cleanup the task manager, remove the testTask from SystemController and have it created in TaskManager if possible
- If the simulation is running/unsaved the Loading Default and Loading file should halt the simulation, but first prompt the user if they're sure.
- Editing the simulation start & end date and the update rate should be disabled while the simulation is running.

QUESTIONS:
- Should every button but the run, pause, reset be disabled while the simulation is running? Also should you have to pause before resetting the simulation?
- Plans for the graphics panel? Changing visuals (lights on in houses with power, polluted air when emissions are high)
- Instead of years, weeks, months for update rates, have an calculate now which just processes everything at the same time? Not sure how that will handle storage strategies
