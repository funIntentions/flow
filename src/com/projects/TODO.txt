Future Thoughts
- Create prefabs/Load in prefabs from a XML file
- Redundancy issue - isPartOf composedOf Owns and other relationships of composition become redundant when represented in software. Particularly with prefabs/groups that will group individuals together into units.
- Alternatively efforts can be focused on representing everything through the simulation
- See if i can reduce the number of HashMaps all storing IndividualModels.
- For the actual simulation, would queries be a good way to take advantage of the ontology? e.g. get all appliances within these sites, sum up their power consumption.
    - How would this complement or hinder the approach wanted where individual agents have a finite view of their surroundings.
- Adding the "Agents"
    - Could be a simulation component that merely monitors the world individuals that it cares about
    - Could be a part of the ontology with relationships that determine how much information they have of the surrounding environment
- How should relationships be handled when prefabs are created?
    - Should they be formed upon the prefabs creation
    - Should they be defined prior to the prefabs creation and then modified once a prefab is created to the new individuals within the prefab
- How to handle prefab nesting, e.g. Apartment Prefab, Residential Apartment Building, Campus Building
- The Ontology currently models an ideal smart grid scenario where every house has a consumption and generation infrastructure. Such restrictions may not allow for the comparisons the simulation needs to make

On Going
- Cleanup the task manager, remove the testTask from SystemController and have it created in TaskManager if possible
- Think more about how the simulation will work... The true meaning of a Prefab... Etc...
- Nested prefabs are a thing that needs to be implemented
- Prefab creation dialog box should preform a robust check on the entered name and suffix (e.i. Are there characters? Are they valid characters.. no : or }, etc)
- Users should have the ability to edit descriptions of Prefabs and instances but probably not classes or individuals...
- errors occur when loading in pizza.owl, This might have something to do with OntClasses having to be a subclass of Thing which does not happen by default.
- Read in properties so that they can be displayed in the tree properly
- Jena/Protege Bug? When an Individual has the same name as its class then it gets its classes description as its own...
- When prefabs are loaded in before the ontology nothing really works... Which it shouldn't but a binding of Prefabs and the Ontology will have to exist

- To Structure Creation Control gui add device name as an option to change
-
- Rename tool bar and menu buttons

- Prefabs as a more rigidly defined construct - extend from Placement, can be of specific types only...
    - Instead of being able to select any combination of Individuals to form a Prefab, there exists only certain types of Prefabs/Things you can create as a Prefab so instead you would go:
    "Create new ResidentialHomeProsumer, MallBuildingProsumer, or ResidentialApartmentConsumer, etc" and there would be a structure procedure for creating this thing.

Potential Changes to ontology to narrow simulations focus
- Remove the very low level components
    - Do this because the agents that will be making decisions in the simulation don't necessarily care about how monitoring and control is done (they care about cause and effect)
    - e.g. inverter, it's part of solar panels and is required so that the generation device can receive
     commands to monitor and control its generation.
