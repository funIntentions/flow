Future Thoughts
- Create prefabs/Load in prefabs from a XML file
- Redundancy issue - isPartOf composedOf Owns and other relationships of composition become redundant when represented in software. Particularly with prefabs/groups that will group individuals together into units.
- Alternatively efforts can be focused on representing everything through the simulation
- See if i can reduce the number of HashMaps all storing IndividualModels.

On Going
- Decide whether to load in the properties in to their respective panels or not
- The TaskManager and tasks aren't functioning and aren't hooked up to the status bar
- Think more about how the simulation will work... The true meaning of a Prefab... Etc...
